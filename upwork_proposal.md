## Project Title
**Professional Multi-Region News Aggregator & Web Scraper Application**

## Project Description

**Overview:**
I have developed a robust, professional-grade web scraping solution designed to aggregate news content from major international publications. This project demonstrates high-performance data engineering capabilities, including asynchronous processing, intelligent rate limiting, and multi-format data export.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-Region Support: Aggregates 10+ sources from Kenya and USA
- High Performance: Async scraping (~50 articles/min) with error handling
- Smart Architecture: Rate limiting, de-duplication, and auto-retries
- Multiple Formats: JSON, CSV, Excel, and SQLite exports
- Full Integration: Includes REST API and automated scheduler
